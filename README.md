### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I have undergone approximately 1,500 hours of learning in my spare time from 2020, mainly focusing on Python, attaining a skill level equivalent to that of a junior developer. 

Also I am currently pursuing an MSCS degree at an American university.


Skillset: Python, Django, Go
